    <h3>"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."</h3>
    <p>After working in customer experience and leadership for nearly a decade, I've realized that great teams and intuitive tools allow people to do the most meaningful work and impactful. I believe that collaboration, feedback, and creativity should replace mindless work and repeatable tasks to drive satisfaction in our jobs. </p>
    <p>Six months ago, I embarked on my coding journey hoping to elevate what working together could look like.</p>

        <li>Trail running in the mountains</li>
        <li>Hanging out with my beautiful family</li>
        <li>Enjoying a beer at a Colorado craft brewery</li>
        <li>Reading about how to properly take care of curly hair</li>
